    The resulting commit message has the form "<risk> <intention> <comment>",
    e.g. ". test_only Add approval test". Call `notation_reference` first to
    see the full list of intentions and risk levels and what each means.

    By default assumes changes are already staged (`git add`) at `location`.
    Pass `paths` to stage those paths (relative to `location`; an empty list
    or `["."]` stages everything) atomically as part of this same call,
    instead of staging separately first. Paths must resolve inside
    `location`; anything escaping it via `..`, an absolute path, or a
    symlink is rejected. There is no separate `stage`/`commit_files` tool —
    this `paths` parameter is the only staging mechanism this server
    provides.

    Pass `theme_slug` to group this commit with others under a feature theme
    (a lowercase, hyphenated slug, e.g. "checkout-redesign"). `theme_mode`
    defaults to "d_shaped_merge" if omitted; pass "inline" explicitly for
    that mode instead. Passing `theme_mode` without a `theme_slug` raises,
    since there's no slug to name the branch or tag the message with:

    - `theme_mode="inline"`: the slug is embedded in this commit's message,
      e.g. ". f [checkout-redesign] Add validation".
    - `theme_mode="d_shaped_merge"`: this commit is made on a branch named
      after the slug (created from the current HEAD the first time it's
      used) instead of the current branch. Call `close_theme` afterwards to
      merge that branch back with `slug` as the merge commit's message,
      forming a "D" shape in the history.

        location: Path to the Git repository (or a directory inside it).
        intention: The author's intention for the change, e.g. "feature" or "test_only".

        comment: The commit summary text.
        theme_slug: Feature theme slug to group this commit under, if any.
        theme_mode: How to group commits under `theme_slug`; defaults to "d_shaped_merge".
        paths: Paths to stage before committing, if not already staged.
